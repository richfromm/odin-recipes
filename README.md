# odin-recipes

[Assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes)
in foundations course for The Odin Project

## Why

The point of this is to demonstrate basic HTML knowledge (w/o CSS).

This is pretty basic and not really new to me, but I'm trying to keep
with the spirit and not be skipping too many large chunks of
this. Actual new Javascript knowledge coming soon...

## What

I included 2 real recipes, and 1 joke.
