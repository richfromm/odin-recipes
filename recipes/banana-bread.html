    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      I have been making this recipe for many years. You can scale it
      up (or down) as needed. I often make 3 loaves at a
      time. Sometimes 4, but that's pushing the capacity of my Kitchen
      Aid stand mixer.
    </p>
    <p>
      On several occasions in the early 2000s I scaled this up to make
      9 loaves at a time, then did that repeatedly, to bring mass
      quantities to Burning Man. Hence its nickname, "The Moistest
      Thing on the Playa". At the peak (2001?) I made more than 50
      loaves one year. You kind of need to work hard to give away that
      much banana bread. Thank goodness for
      <a href="http://bianca.org/history/burn.html">bianca's</a>, and
      remember that <em>bianca loves you</em>

      Don't go overboard on the bananas, or you can end up with a
      section in the center which is undercooked.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 stick butter (room temperature), plus more for greasing pan(s)</li>
      <li>⅔ cup brown sugar</li>
      <li>8 bananas (very ripe), or about 3 cups</li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>⅔ cup white sugar</li>
      <li>2 tsp. vanilla</li>
      <li>1½ cups white flour</li>
      <li>1½ cups whole wheat flour</li>
      <li>2 tsp. salt</li>
      <li>2 tsp. baking soda</li>
      <li>2 tsp. cinnamon</li>
      <li>1 tsp. nutmeg</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F.</li>
      <li>Cream the butter in a mixer at high speed. Add the brown sugar and continue to beat until light and fluffy. Add the bananas one at a time with the mixer on medium. Add the eggs, white sugar, and vanilla, and mix until well blended.</li>
      <li>In another bowl, whisk together the white and whole wheat flours, salt, baking soda, cinnamon, and nutmeg. With the mixer on medium-low, add the dry ingredients gradually, until no dry spots remain.</li>
      <li>Liberally grease either two loaf pans, or one 9×13 baking dish, with butter. Spread the batter into the pans, being sure to get it in all of the edges and corners.</li>
      <li>Bake for approximately 1 hour (check earlier), until a toothpick comes out clean.</li>
    </ol>
